# Simple Todo App

This is a simple Task list, providing practice re-factoring code to use classes rather than functions.

## Functionality

It lets you create a simple to do list that lasts as long as you leave the browser window open. Each task can be checked off as completed, or deleted entirely from the list.

## Technology

Sample project, implementing javascript modules and classes, practice in OOP. Each task receives a unique id value from an external module -- u4 available at:
